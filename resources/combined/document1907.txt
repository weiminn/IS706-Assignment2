   @wiphy  the wiphy for which we want to process this rule for
   @center freq  Frequency in KHz for which we want regulatory information for
   @desired bw khz  the desired max bandwidth you want to use per
  	channel  Note that this is still 20 MHz if you want to use HT40
  	as HT40 makes use of two channels for its 40 MHz width bandwidth 
  	If set to 0 we'll assume you want the standard 20 MHz 
   @reg rule  the regulatory rule which we have for this frequency
  
   Use this function to get the regulatory rule for a specific frequency on
   a given wireless device  If the device has a specific regulatory domain
   it wants to follow we respect that unless a country IE has been received
   and processed already 
  
   Returns 0 if it was able to find a valid regulatory rule which does
   apply to the given center freq otherwise it returns non zero  It will
   also return  ERANGE if we determine the given center freq does not even have
   a regulatory rule for a frequency range in the center freq's band  See
   freq in rule band   for our current definition of a band    this is purely
   subjective and right now its 802 11 specific
