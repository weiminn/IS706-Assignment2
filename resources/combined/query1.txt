TASK DELAY ACCT
Enable per-task delay accounting (EXPERIMENTAL)
Collect information on time spent by a task waiting for system
resources like cpu, synchronous block I/O completion and swapping
in pages. Such statistics can help in setting a task's priorities
relative to other tasks for cpu, io, rss limits etc.

Say N if unsure.
