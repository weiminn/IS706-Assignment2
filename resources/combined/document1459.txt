   @tfile  A struct ttm object file representing the application owning the
   ref object 
   @base  The base object to reference 
   @ref type  The type of reference 
   @existed  Upon completion  indicates that an identical reference object
   already existed  and the refcount was upped on that object instead 
  
   Adding a ref object to a base object is basically like referencing the
   base object  but a user space application holds the reference  When the
   file corresponding to @tfile is closed  all its reference objects are
   deleted  A reference object can have different types depending on what
   it's intended for  It can be refcounting to prevent object destruction 
   When user space takes a lock  it can add a ref object to that lock to
   make sure the lock is released if the application dies  A ref object
   will hold a single reference on a base object
