  
   Add a slave control to the group with the given master control
  
   All slaves must be the same type  returning the same information
   via info callback    The fucntion doesn't check it  so it's your
   responsibility 
  
   Also  some additional limitations 
     at most two channels
     logarithmic volume control  dB level   no linear volume
     master can only attenuate the volume  no gain
