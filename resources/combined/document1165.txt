   @ttm A struct ttm tt the backing pages of which will change caching policy 
   @placement  Flag indicating the desired caching policy 
  
   This function will change caching policy of any default kernel mappings of
   the pages backing @ttm  If changing from cached to uncached or
   write combined 
   all CPU caches will first be flushed to make sure the data of the pages
   hit RAM  This function may be very costly as it involves global TLB
   and cache flushes and potential page splitting   combining
