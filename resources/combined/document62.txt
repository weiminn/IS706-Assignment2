   
   snd device new   create an ALSA device component
   @card  the card instance
   @type  the device type  SNDRV DEV XXX
   @device data  the data pointer of this device
   @ops  the operator table
  
   Creates a new device component for the given data pointer 
   The device will be assigned to the card and managed together
   by the card 
  
   The data pointer plays a role as the identifier  too  so the
   pointer address must be unique and unchanged 
  
   Returns zero if successful  or a negative error code on failure
