   
   wiphy to ieee80211 hw   return a mac80211 driver hw struct from a wiphy
  
   @wiphy  the  struct wiphy which we want to query
  
   mac80211 drivers can use this to get to their respective
    struct ieee80211 hw  Drivers wishing to get to their own private
   structure can then access it via hw priv  Note that mac802111 drivers should
   not use wiphy priv   to try to get their private driver structure as this
   is already used internally by mac80211 
   
struct ieee80211 hw  wiphy to ieee80211 hw struct wiphy  wiphy
