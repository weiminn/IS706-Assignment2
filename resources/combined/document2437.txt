  
   Private helper functions for loss detection 
  
   In the descriptions  `Si' refers to the sequence number of entry number i 
   whose NDP count is `Ni'  lower case is used for variables  
   Note  All   xxx loss functions expect that a test against duplicates has been
         performed already  the seqno of the skb must not be less than the seqno
         of loss prev  and it must not equal that of any valid history entry 
   
static void   do track loss struct tfrc rx hist  h  struct sk buff  skb  u64 n1 
{
	u64 s0 = tfrc rx hist loss prev h  tfrchrx seqno 
	    s1 = DCCP SKB CB skb  dccpd seq 

	if   dccp loss free s0  s1  n1   {	   gap between S0 and S1   
		h loss count = 1 
		tfrc rx hist entry from skb tfrc rx hist entry h  1   skb  n1  
	}
