BLK CGROUP
Block IO controller
Generic block IO controller cgroup interface. This is the common
cgroup interface which should be used by various IO controlling
policies.

Currently, CFQ IO scheduler uses it to recognize task groups and
control disk bandwidth allocation (proportional time slice allocation)
to such task groups. It is also used by bio throttling logic in
block layer to implement upper limit in IO rates on a device.

This option only enables generic Block IO controller infrastructure.
One needs to also enable actual IO controlling logic/policy. For
enabling proportional weight division of disk bandwidth in CFQ seti
CONFIG_CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED=y and for enabling throttling policy set
CONFIG_BLK_THROTTLE=y.

See Documentation/cgroups/blkio-controller.txt for more information.
