   @vif   struct ieee80211 vif pointer from the add interface callback 
  
   When beacon filtering is enabled with  IEEE80211 HW BEACON FILTER  and
    IEEE80211 CONF PS and  IEEE80211 HW CONNECTION MONITOR are set  the driver
   needs to inform if the connection to the AP has been lost 
  
   This function will cause immediate change to disassociated state
