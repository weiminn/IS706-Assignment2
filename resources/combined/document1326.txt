   @list     thread private list of ttm validate buffer structs 
  
   Tries to reserve bos pointed to by the list entries for validation 
   If the function returns 0  all buffers are marked as  unfenced  
   taken off the lru lists and are not synced for write CPU usage 
  
   If the function detects a deadlock due to multiple threads trying to
   reserve the same buffers in reverse order  all threads except one will
   back off and retry  This function may sleep while waiting for
   CPU write reservations to be cleared  and for other threads to
   unreserve their buffers 
  
   This function may return  ERESTART or  EAGAIN if the calling process
   receives a signal while waiting  In that case  no buffers on the list
   will be reserved upon return 
  
   Buffers reserved by this function should be unreserved by
   a call to either ttm eu backoff reservation   or
   ttm eu fence buffer objects   when command submission is complete or
   has failed
