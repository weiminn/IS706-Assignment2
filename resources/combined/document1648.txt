  
   This makes me sad  the maestro3 has lists
   internally that must be packed   0 terminates 
   apparently  or maybe all unused entries have
   to be 0  the lists have static lengths set
   by the binary code images 
   
static int snd m3 add list struct snd m3  chip  struct m3 list  list  u16 val 
{
	snd m3 assp write chip  MEMTYPE INTERNAL DATA 
			  list mem addr + list curlen 
			  val  
	return list curlen++ 
}
