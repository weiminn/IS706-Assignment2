   @bo  A pointer to a struct ttm buffer object 
   @sync obj  A sync object that signals when moving is complete 
   @sync obj arg  An argument to pass to the sync object idle   wait
   functions 
   @evict  This is an evict move  Don't return until the buffer is idle 
   @no wait reserve  Return immediately if other buffers are busy 
   @no wait gpu  Return immediately if the GPU is busy 
   @new mem  struct ttm mem reg indicating where to move 
  
   Accelerated move function to be called when an accelerated move
   has been scheduled  The function will create a new temporary buffer object
   representing the old placement  and put the sync object on both buffer
   objects  After that the newly created buffer object is unref'd to be
   destroyed when the move is complete  This will help pipeline
   buffer moves
