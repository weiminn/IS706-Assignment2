   @bo  Pointer to a struct ttm buffer object  the data of which
   we want to allocate space for 
   @proposed placement  Proposed new placement for the buffer object 
   @mem  A struct ttm mem reg 
   @interruptible  Sleep interruptible when sliping 
   @no wait reserve  Return immediately if other buffers are busy 
   @no wait gpu  Return immediately if the GPU is busy 
  
   Allocate memory space for the buffer object pointed to by @bo  using
   the placement flags in @mem  potentially evicting other idle buffer objects 
   This function may sleep while waiting for space to become available 
   Returns 
    EBUSY  No space available  only if no wait == 1  
    ENOMEM  Could not allocate memory for the buffer object  either due to
   fragmentation or concurrent allocators 
    ERESTARTSYS  An interruptible sleep was interrupted by a signal
