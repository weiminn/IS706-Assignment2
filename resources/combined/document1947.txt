   @hw  pointer as obtained from ieee80211 alloc hw   
   @vif   struct ieee80211 vif pointer from the add interface callback 
  
   Function for accessing buffered broadcast and multicast frames  If
   hardware firmware does not implement buffering of broadcast multicast
   frames when power saving is used  802 11 code buffers them in the host
   memory  The low level driver uses this function to fetch next buffered
   frame  In most cases  this is used when generating beacon frame  This
   function returns a pointer to the next buffered skb or NULL if no more
   buffered frames are available 
  
   Note  buffered frames are returned only after DTIM beacon frame was
   generated with ieee80211 beacon get   and the low level driver must thus
   call ieee80211 beacon get   first  ieee80211 get buffered bc   returns
   NULL if the previous generated beacon was not DTIM  so the low level driver
   does not need to check for DTIM beacons separately and should be able to
   use common code for all beacons
