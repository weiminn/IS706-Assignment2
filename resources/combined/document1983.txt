  
   Read write from to an  offsettable  iomem cookie  It might be a PIO
   access or a MMIO access  these functions don't care  The info is
   encoded in the hardware mapping set up by the mapping functions
    or the cookie itself  depending on implementation and hw  
  
   The generic routines just encode the PIO MMIO as part of the
   cookie  and coldly assume that the MMIO IO mappings are not
   in the low address range  Architectures for which this is not
   true can't use this generic implementation
