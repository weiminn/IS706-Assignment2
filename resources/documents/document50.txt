   
   snd card proc new   create an info entry for the given card
   @card  the card instance
   @name  the file name
   @entryp  the pointer to store the new info entry
  
   Creates a new info entry and assigns it to the given card 
   Unlike snd info create card entry    this function registers the
   info entry as an ALSA device component  so that it can be
   unregistered released without explicit call 
   Also  you don't have to register this entry via snd info register   
   since this will be registered by snd card register   automatically 
  
   The parent is assumed as card proc root 
  
   For releasing this entry  use snd device free   instead of
   snd info free entry    
  
   Returns zero if successful  or a negative error code on failure
