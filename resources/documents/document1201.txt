   
   Returns the pointer to the dword which is offset number of elements from the
   current processing location 
  
   Caller must make sure that dword is not split in the buffer  This
   requirement is easily met if all the sizes of objects in buffer are
   multiples of dword and PAGE SIZE is multiple dword 
  
   Call to this function doesn't change the processing location 
  
     offset  The index of the dword relative to the internat iterator

	int iter = buffer iterator + offset   4 
	return  buffer data iter   PAGE SIZE  iter    PAGE SIZE   1
