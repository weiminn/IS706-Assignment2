   When @loss event rate is large  there is a chance that p is truncated to 0 
   To avoid re entering slow start in that case  we set p = TFRC SMALLEST P   0

	if  unlikely loss event rate == 0  		   map 1 0 into 100    
		return 1000000 
	return max t u32  scaled div 1  loss event rate   TFRC SMALLEST P
