   Some hardware require full power save to manage simultaneous BT traffic
   on the WLAN frequency  Full PSM is required periodically  whenever there are
   burst of BT traffic  The hardware gets information of BT traffic via
   hardware co existence lines  and consequentially requests mac80211 to
    temporarily  enter full psm 
   This function will only temporarily disable dynamic PS  not enable PSM if
   it was not already enabled 
   The driver must make sure to re enable dynamic PS using
   ieee80211 enable dyn ps   if the driver has disabled it
