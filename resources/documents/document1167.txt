   @new mem  struct ttm mem reg indicating where to move 
  
   Optimized move function for a buffer object with both old and
   new placement backed by a TTM  The function will  if successful 
   free any old aperture space  and set  @new mem  mm node to NULL 
   and update the  @bo  mem placement flags  If unsuccessful  the old
   data remains untouched  and it's up to the caller to free the
