snd azf3328 io reg setb unsigned reg  u8 mask  bool do set 
{
	   Well  strictly spoken  the inb outb sequence isn't atomic
	   and would need locking  However we currently don't care
	   since it potentially complicates matters    
	u8 prev = inb reg   new 

	new =  do set  ?  prev|mask     prev   ~mask  
	   we need to always write the new value no matter whether it differs
	   or not  since some register bits don't indicate their setting   
	outb new  reg  
	if  new  = prev 
		return 1 

	return 0 
}
