   @dmab  the buffer allocation record to store
   @id  the buffer id
  
   Looks for the reserved buffer list and re uses if the same buffer
   is found in the list   When the buffer is found  it's removed from the free list 
  
   Returns the size of buffer if the buffer is found  or zero if not found

	struct snd mem list  mem 

	if  WARN ON  dmab  
		return 0 

	mutex lock  list mutex  
	list for each entry mem   mem list head  list  {
