   @bdev  Pointer to a ttm bo device struct 
   @mem type  The memory type 
  
   Take down a manager for a given memory type after first walking
   the LRU list to evict any buffers left alive 
  
   Normally  this function is part of lastclose   or unload    and at that
   point there shouldn't be any buffers left created by user space  since
   there should've been removed by the file descriptor release   method 
   However  before this function is run  make sure to signal all sync objects 
   and verify that the delayed delete queue is empty  The driver must also
   make sure that there are no NO EVICT buffers present in this memory type
   when the call is made 
  
   If this function is part of a VT switch  the caller must make sure that
   there are no appications currently validating buffers before this
   function is called  The caller can do that by first taking the
   struct ttm bo device  ttm lock in write mode 
  
   Returns 
    EINVAL  invalid or uninitialized memory type 
    EBUSY  There are still buffers left in this memory type
