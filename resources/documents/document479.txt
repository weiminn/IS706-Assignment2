   @name  base name of the device we're adding
   @id  instance id
   @res  set of resources that needs to be allocated for the device
   @num  number of resources
  
   This function creates a simple platform device that requires minimal
   resource and memory management  Canned release function freeing memory
   allocated for the device allows drivers using such devices to be
   unloaded without waiting for the last reference to the device to be
   dropped 
  
   This interface is primarily intended for use with legacy drivers which
   probe hardware directly   Because such drivers create sysfs device nodes
   themselves  rather than letting system infrastructure handle such device
   enumeration tasks  they don't fully conform to the Linux driver model 
   In particular  when such drivers are built as modules  they can't be
    hotplugged
