   num managers are the number of memory pools to manage   VRAM  AGP       
   user order is the log2 of the number of buckets in the user hash table 
  	    set this to approximately log2 of the max number of memory regions
  	    that will be allocated for  all  pools together 
   owner order is the log2 of the number of buckets in the owner hash table 
  	    set this to approximately log2 of
