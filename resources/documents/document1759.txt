   @sband  the band to look for rates in
   @basic rates  bitmap of basic rates
   @bitrate  the bitrate for which to find the basic rate
  
   This function returns the basic rate corresponding to a given
   bitrate  that is the next lower bitrate contained in the basic
   rate map  which is  for this function  given as a bitmap of
   indices of rates in the band's bitrate table
