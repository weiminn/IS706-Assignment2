   @bo  A pointer to a struct ttm buffer object 
   @interruptible  Sleep interruptible if waiting 
   @no wait  Don't sleep while trying to reserve  rather return  EBUSY 
   @use sequence  If @bo is already reserved  Only sleep waiting for
   it to become unreserved if @sequence    @bo  sequence 
  
   Must be called with struct ttm bo global  lru lock held 
   and will not remove reserved buffers from the lru lists 
   The function may release the LRU spinlock if it needs to sleep 
   Otherwise identical to ttm bo reserve 
  
   Returns 
    EAGAIN  The reservation may cause a deadlock 
   Release all buffer reservations  wait for @bo to become unreserved and
   try again   only if use sequence == 1  
    ERESTARTSYS  A wait for the buffer to become unreserved was interrupted by
   a signal  Release all buffer reservations and return to user space 
    EBUSY  The function needed to sleep  but @no wait was true
    EDEADLK  Bo already reserved using @sequence  This error code will only
   be returned if @use sequence is set to true
