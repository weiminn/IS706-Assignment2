   @bo  A pointer to a struct ttm buffer object 
   @evict  1  This is an eviction  Don't try to pipeline 
   @no wait reserve  Return immediately if other buffers are busy 
   @no wait gpu  Return immediately if the GPU is busy 
   @new mem  struct ttm mem reg indicating where to move 
  
   Fallback move function for a mappable buffer object in mappable memory 
   The function will  if successful 
   free any old aperture space  and set  @new mem  mm node to NULL 
   and update the  @bo  mem placement flags  If unsuccessful  the old
   data remains untouched  and it's up to the caller to free the
   memory space indicated by @new mem 
   Returns 
    0  Failure
