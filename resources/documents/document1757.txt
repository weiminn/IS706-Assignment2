   @hw  pointer obtained from ieee80211 alloc hw   
   @vif   struct ieee80211 vif pointer from the add interface callback 
   @frame  pointer to the frame that is going to be protected by the CTS to self 
   @frame len  the frame length  in octets  
   @frame txctl   struct ieee80211 tx info of the frame 
   @cts  The buffer where to store the CTS to self frame 
  
   If the CTS to self frames are generated by the host system  i e   not in
   hardware firmware   the low level driver uses this function to receive
   the next CTS to self frame from the 802 11 code  The low level is responsible
   for calling this function before and CTS to self frame is needed
