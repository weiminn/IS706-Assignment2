   parport release reverses a previous parport claim   This can never
   fail  though the effects are undefined  except that they are bad 
   if you didn't previously own the port   Once you have released the
   port you should make sure that neither your code nor the hardware
   on the port tries to initiate any communication without first
   re claiming the port   If you mess with the port state  enabling
   ECP for example  you should clean up before releasing the port    
extern void parport release struct pardevice  dev
