   This function computes a TKIP rc4 key for an skb  It computes
   a phase 1 key if needed  iv16 wraps around   This function is to
   be used by drivers which can do HW encryption but need to compute
   to phase 1 2 key in SW 
  
   @keyconf  the parameter passed with the set key
   @skb  the skb for which the key is needed
   @type  TBD
   @key  a buffer to which the key will be written
