   @list  a new list to add all removed entries
   @head  a list with entries
   @entry  an entry within head  could be the head itself
  	and if so we won't cut the list
  
   This helper moves the initial part of @head  up to and
   including @entry  from @head to @list  You should
   pass on @entry an element you know is on @head  @list
   should be an empty list or a list you do not care about
   losing its data
